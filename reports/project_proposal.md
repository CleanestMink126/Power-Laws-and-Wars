To answer why the casualty levels of wars are power-law distributed as shown in Richardson's discovery, Cederman proposed an agent-based model of war and state formation called GeoSim that replicates the empirically expected power-law distribution. He agrees that previous models that utilize the characterstic of SOC(sand-pile, forest-fire model) do explain how wars spread, but he points out that those results do not necesarily explain how wars are initiated. His model consists of state-like agents that either fight against neighbors or don't fight over allocated resources. He concludes that technological changes contribute to the decisions to wage war and that the scale-free behavior of wars depend on them.
