1. Question : What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
      * I already knew the experiment so my understanding of it is pretty solid

      *  They want to show how the model they defined can fit into either high defector or low defector states

      * Your explanation was pretty much spot on.

2. Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
      * I understand the question you are asking it makes sense for the question. I wonder how a router would go about sharing data between parents? Would the differing latencies of the parents cause complications? (To be honest I don't know enough about Internet routing to know if this is a legitimate question)
      * Also given the way you phrased your question, I feel like it would be near impossible for a distributed network to be worse than a singular one. I imagine there would be some computation required in finding other routers and divying up requests. Maybe it would make sense for there to be some penalty based on amount of people you are getting data from and the process of finding more routers?

3. Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
      * Label your graphs! The line graphs are good but the Single and Multi Connection graphs were super helpful in my understanding of your methodology and the blue vs dark red vs light red vs white is not explained. Also probably put a graph like that earlier to help with understanding and maybe label the super routers?
4. Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
      * Yes! I liked the question and the graphs give a concise answer.

5. Replication:  Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  
      * There is very little overlap between this and the original paper so they cannot be compared.

6. Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
      * Again, no real overlap so i would not consider this an extension as much as a different route (to be honest I like this 100x more that the other paper though)


7. Progress:  Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
      * Yes! Looks like great progress.

 8. Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?
      * It does not really replicate or extend the original paper at all, but besides that I think it all lookes good.
