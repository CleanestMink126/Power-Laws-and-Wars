5. Replication:
      * The results of page rank algorithm replication are consistent with the results from the original paper.

6. Extension:
      * I see that you are extending your experiment by applying the same methodology used in BA and ER grphs to a collaboration network.

7. Progress:
      * I see that the implementation of the algorithms and simulations is complete. The replication is complete and the extension is complete too. It

8. Presentation:
    * I see several places where you use the past tense when you could in fact use the present tense instead.

9. Mechanics:
